# Usability testing

## Participants

Pick users who have not use system.

| Group | Total number |
| ----- | ------------ |
| 18-45 | 10           |
| 45+   | 10           |



## Training

The participants will receive and overview of the usability test procedure, equipment and software.



## Produre

Participants will take part in the usability test via remote screen-sharing technology. The participant will be seated at their workstation in their work environment. Verbal communication will be supported via telephone.

- Complete a pretest demographic and background information questionnaire (baisc information)
- Time-on-task measure will begin. The facilitator will encourage the participants to ‘think aloud’ and that a verbal record will exist of the task-system interaction. The facilitator will observe and enter user behavior and comments, and system interaction in a data logging application. Complete specific task, including：
  - Book a flight ticket and choose the date and destination.
  - Book a hotel at your destination, choosing the date and the number of clients.
  - Select a combination of hotel and flight, complete basic information and make sure it is right.

- Note takers record how long it takes for participants to perform specific tasks (measure efficiency) **whether a second time task after a period of time is necessary?** (memorability)
- Participants will complete a pretest demographic and background information questionnaire. (measure satisfaction) 



## Usability Metrics

Usability metrics refers to user performance measured against specific performance goals necessary to satisfy usability requirements. Scenario completion success rates, adherence to dialog scripts, error rates, and subjective evaluations will be used. Time-to-completion of scenarios will also be collected.

- **Scenario Completion (whether successfully or unsuccessfully)**
- Critical Errors 
- Non-critical Errors
- Subjective Evaluations (Subjective evaluations regarding ease of use and satisfaction will be collected via questionnaires)
- **Scenario Completion Time (time on task)**
- **Steps (?)**
- count the number of actions/mistakes made by users while performing specified tasks (量化？) ---- safety



## Usability Goals

- Completion Rate
- Error-free rate
- Time on Task (TOT)
- Subjective Measures
